This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error where the use of `>` (greater than) unintentionally excludes records matching the threshold value. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, and `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  This subtle bug highlights the importance of carefully considering comparison operators in SQL queries to ensure the desired results are obtained.
